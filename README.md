# Visual Binary Search Tree

Small project developed to demonstrate, to the students of the Algorithms and Data Structures I course (Computer Engineering/UFMA), the elements insertion process of a Binary Search Tree.

The drawing of the trees still need to be improved: since the nodes are positioned considering half of the available space (in the left or in the right), the canvas runs out of space quickly. Thus, this project should be used to test small height trees.

Maybe in the future I can replace the Canvas2D by the use of Virtual DOM elements, but 
Talvez no futuro eu substitua o uso do Canvas2D pela Virtual DOM, but I thought it would be fun to do this with Canvas. ðŸ˜‰
